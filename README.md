# User Experience

## Design Choices

### Fonts

The fonts used for this project are Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif. This was used for all aspects of the page to remain consistent with the theme set for the pages and the design across multiple pages.

### Color Scheme

The colour scheme for this project is largely centered around the background colours and trying to fit in with that as well as being noticeable. The colours used are as follows:
* H1,P,A. White
* H2 Home page, White, Red, rgba(9, 86, 185, 0.938)
* H2 All other pages, rgba(9, 86, 185, 0.938)
* Nav and Footer, Linear Gradient, rgba(9, 86, 185, 0.938) into Black

# Features

* This website features 4 pages, home.html (homepage), about.html(about us), contact.html(contact us) and open.html(Opening Hours). The website is designed to be basic and simplistic so that the user can easily find what they are looking for and access information in the most simplistic way possible.

## Nav menu

* Nav menu uses a linear gradient with opacity set to 50%, the currently active link will stay underlined after the page has been loaded in so the user knows which page they are currently on.
* Nav menu is also responsive in regards to screen widths and heights.

Changes are regarding paragraph size and h2 element size, additionally with the width the size of my div on each page will vary depeinding on the width.
* Multiple Media queries for height have been applied due to certain elements overflowing on the pages. these height changes occur at, 655px,851px,896px,915px,1180px,1368px and 740px. Changes are regarding Font size of paragraphs and H2 elements. additionally smaller screen heights remove the footer so text can fill the space.

# Future Features

For the future of this page, I would consider adding in a page that allows people to ask questions and post them on the website as an FAQ page. Additionally i would also like to add an online membership so that people who wish to join the gym can sign up online and pay online for their memberships. To add to this I would also like to add a booking system for the website so that people can book appointments with a Personal Trainer Via the website.

## Responsiveness Test

I have conducted a responsiveness test on this project using the developer tools in google chrome for every device type that is available within the Chrome Dev tools. During the process some adjustments had to be made to media queries, however after making these changes the website has responded well and the appearance of the website on multiple devices would be considered as acceptable. Additionally no features have been removed during this time. Further too this all Links and images are fully working on every device however on some mobiles in future a hamburger menu may be more applicable.

# Bugs and Fixes

* Open.html page errors. Fixed.
 
![errors-on-open-html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101630755/170022716-921f58f1-c6b4-4dff-ba3d-55cc73787c23.png)

    -moz-background-size:cover;
